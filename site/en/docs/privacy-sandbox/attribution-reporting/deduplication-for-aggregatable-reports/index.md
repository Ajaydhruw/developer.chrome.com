**Dealing with duplicate reports** 

At times, you may receive the same report more than once because if the browser is offline and has to retry, it may end up sending a report multiple times.

You can find and ignore duplicate reports by checking their `report_id`.
Ignore a report if you've already received one with the same `report_id`.

There are two properties you can use for indicating duplicates to deduplicate aggregatable reports: `aggregatable_deduplication_keys` and filters.

## Using aggregatable_deduplication_keys

You can set deduplication keys like so in your header:

```json
  "aggregatable_deduplication_keys": [
    {
      "deduplication_key": "1231232123123",
    },
  ]
```

Here, if this attribution trigger is matched to a source, then an aggregatable report is generated and has a deduplication key of `1231232123123`.

## Using filters

You can also deduplicate aggregatable reports based on filter data.

This example illustrates the use of filters:

```json
  "aggregatable_deduplication_keys": [
    {
      "deduplication_key": "1231232123123",
      "filters": {"conversion_type": ["homepage_view", "productpage_view"]}
    },
    {
      "deduplication_key": "789789789789",
      "filters": {"conversion_type": ["purchase"]}
    }
  ]
```
In this example:

* If this trigger is matched to a conversion of type `homepage_view` or `productpage_view`, then an aggregatable report is generated and has a deduplication key of `1231232123123`.
* If this trigger is matched to a conversion of type `purchase`, then an aggregatable report is generated and has a deduplication key of `789789789789`.
* If multiple deduplication keys match the filter data, then the first matched one is used.

## Migrating deduplication keys

If you were using a deduplication key for aggregatable reports (`aggregatable_deduplication_key`), before Chrome 112 and you're not using filters for your aggregatable reports, or if you're not interested in basing your aggregatable deduplication keys on filters:

1. Replace `aggregatable_deduplication_key` with `aggregatable_deduplication_keys`.

1. Wrap your existing key between brackets as in the "new" example:

    Old

    ```json
    "aggregatable_deduplication_key": "123123123"
    ```

    New

    ```json
      "aggregatable_deduplication_keys": [
        {
           "deduplication_key": "123123123"
        }
      ]
    ```

If you are using filters for your aggregatable reports, and would like to make your deduplication keys vary based on the filtersâ€”that is, if you would like to benefit from this new feature, follow these steps:

1. Replace `aggregatable_deduplication_key` with `aggregatable_deduplication_keys`.

1. Define your aggregation keys based on filters, as in the example that follows. Note that if multiple deduplication keys match the filter data, then the first matched one is used.

    ```json
    aggregatable_trigger_data:
    [{  
      "key_piece": "...",
      "source_keys": ["..."],
      "filters": {
        "filter_1": [a, b]
      }
    },{  
      "key_piece": "...",
      "source_keys": ["..."],
      "filters": {
        "filter_1": [c, d]
      }
    }]

    aggregatable_deduplication_keys:
    [{  
      "deduplication_key": "123123123",
      "filters": {
        "filter_1": ["a", "b"]
      }
    },{  
      "deduplication_key": "456456456",
      "filters": {
        "filter_1": ["c", "d"]
      }
    }]
    ```
