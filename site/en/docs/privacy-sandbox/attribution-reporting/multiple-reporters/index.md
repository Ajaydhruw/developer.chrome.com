It is possible to register multiple reporters generate and receive attribution reports by registering separate triggers. What follows are the two mechanisms available to accomplsh this.


## Registering multiple triggers without redirects

It's possible to register multiple attribution triggers without using redirects, by adding multiple pixel elements on the conversion side (one per trigger).

## Registering several triggers using redirects

In this example, reporter-1.example and reporter-2.example are two distinct entities looking to generate and receive attribution reports.

At source registration time:

1. `reporter-1.example` receives a request from the browser.

1. `reporter-1.example` sends a response that contains the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header. It could be a regular response but, in this example, it's a redirect to `reporter-2.example`.

1. The browser receives this response. It reads `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` and hence stores a source event, using `reporter-1.example` as the reporting origin. 

1. Because this request is a redirect, the browser also makes a new request to `reporter-2.example`.

1. `reporter-2.example` responds with a regular response that contains the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header. The destination value in this header must be identical to the destination value of the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header set by `reporter-1.example`. Otherwise, the source will not be registered.

1. The browser receives this response; it reads `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` and stores a source event, using `reporter-2.example` as the reporting origin.

If `reporter-1` intends to rely completely on `reporter-2` as a measurement service, and does not intend to do any measurement themselves, `reporter-1.example` can omit the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header at Step 2.

At trigger registration time:

1. Requests can be redirected in the same way as for source registration. 

1. Source events and trigger events that have been generated by the same origins will be matchedâ€”respectively, `reporter-1.example` and `reporter-2.example`.
