The first step in getting ready for the deprecation of 3P cookies is to ensure we have a firm grasp of the fundamental concepts and technical details surrounding cookies. What are they exactly? How do they work? What's the difference between first-party and third-party cookies? What exactly will change after 3P cookies are deprecated?

Start with the Section [Cookies in a Nutshell](/3pcd-readiness/#cookies-in-a-nutshell), where you can get the fundamentals of cookies; you can check further the myriad of content avaiable online to learn everything about cookies, but just knowing the fundamentals will go a long way on making it easier for you to get ready for the deprecation of 3P cookies.

And keep these points in mind as you get ready:

- Cookies are tiny pieces of code that websites place on a visitor's browser to remember their activity or preferences. They can be used to implement a vaariety of legitimate use case which are important for the web user experience.
- There are two main types of cookies, depending on how are they set and accessed. First-Party Cookies are created by the website that the user is currently visiting. They enable core functionalities like remembering login details, products added to the cart, and providing a personalized user experience. Third-Party Cookies: These are created by websites other than the one the user is currently visiting, mainly for tracking and online-advertising purposes.
- The deprecation of 3P cookies won't eliminate all cookiesâ€”just those set by third parties. Your own website's first-party cookies won't be affected.
