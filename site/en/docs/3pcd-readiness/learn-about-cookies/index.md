The first step in getting ready for the deprecation of third-party cookies is to ensure you have a firm grasp of the fundamental concepts and technical details surrounding cookies. What are they exactly? How do they work? What's the difference between first-party and third-party cookies? What exactly will change after third-party cookies are deprecated?

Start with the Section [Cookies in a Nutshell](/3pcd-readiness/#cookies-in-a-nutshell), where you can review the fundamentals of cookies; you can take a look at the myriad of content avaiable online to learn everything about cookies, but knowing the fundamentals will go a long way to get ready for the deprecation of third-party cookies.

And keep these points in mind as you get ready:

- Cookies are tiny pieces of code that websites place in a visitor's browser to remember their activity or preferences. They can be used to implement a variety of legitimate use cases that are important for the user experience.
- There are two main types of cookies, which differ by how are they set and accessed. First-party cookies are created by the website that the user is currently visiting. They enable core functionalities such as remembering login details, products added to the cart, and providing a personalized user experience. Third-party cookies are created by websites other than the one the user is currently visiting, mainly for tracking and online advertising purposes.
- The deprecation of third-party cookies won't eliminate all cookiesâ€”just those set by third parties. Your own website's first-party cookies won't be affected.
- Browser functionality after third-party cookie deprecation will not be identical to the results you get when you block third-party cookies as a user today, so it's best to dig into the details of what's changing, and what's not.
