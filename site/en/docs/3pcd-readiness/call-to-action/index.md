With major web browsers phasing out support for third-party cookies, businesses, developers, and marketers need to reimagine their strategies and get ready for a world without 3P cookies. Depending on our specific roles in the web ecosystem, we will focuse on different practical strategies for preparing and adapting to this transformative shift.

If you are a **first-party site developer**, you are responsible for the creation and maintenance of websites. A significant part of your work involves auditing and managing third-party dependencies to ensure that your websites run smoothly and securely. Leverage the guidance and the tooling available to help you understand the changes to third-party cookie use cases, how to integrate Privacy Sandbox APIs into your solutions, and how to troubleshoot issues that may arise.

If you are a **third-party service developer using valid cookie use cases**, you are responsible for creating and maintaining services that are integrated into other websites as third-party dependencies. If your technologies rely on cookies for various functions, such as maintaining user sessions or tracking user preferences, leverage the guidance and tooling provided to help you stay informed about the effective and responsible use of cookies.

If you are a **third-party service provider transitioning away from cookies**, you are responsible for developing third-party services that rely on cookies (such as tracking, data storage, or user session management), which need to transition to alternate methods due to evolving regulations and platform changes. Leverage the guidance and tooling available to help you integrate Privacy Sandbox APIs into your solutions, and helps troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

If you are a **Website owners or technology leader**, you are responsible for technical and business decision making, and you can leverage the guidance and tooling available to get a thorough understanding of the transformative shift that is taking place for 3P Cookies and the potential impact on user experience and privacy.

Ultimately, we, the web ecosystem, will navigate successfully this crucial transition towards a more private platform. Let's make it happen!
