Eventually 3P cookies will be removed while ensuring that the ecosystem has the technical capabilities for embracing new non-cookie-based solutions (e.g. separating first- and third-party cookies, creating first-party sets, and finally removing third-party cookies).

Some features of the web that people have come to expect, and which greatly improve user experience, currently depend on third-party cookies, and continuing to support these use cases is important.
We strive to replace existing functionality with privacy-preserving techniques. Ideally, from a user's point of view, there should be no noticeable difference between how the web operates today and how it functions in a world after the implementation of the Privacy Sandbox.

As the ability of doing cross-site tracking via 3P cookies is removed, we will ensure developers have a well-lit path to the new capabilities of the platform, and avoid pursuing tracking via other means.
