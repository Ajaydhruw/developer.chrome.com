## Testing on Chrome Release Channels

[Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) and [Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/) are channels of Google's Chrome browser that allow users to test and experience features before they're available in the stable version of Chrome. These channels serve as a platform to introduce and test new features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. Each channel represents a different stage of development and stability.

### Chrome Canary

- Cutting Edge: This is the most experimental version of Chrome. New features and changes are introduced into Canary first.
- Updated Frequently: It typically receives updates daily. This rapid update schedule means users can see the latest features and fixes very quickly but also introduces the potential for more bugs and instability.
- For Developers and Early Adopters: Because of its experimental nature, Canary is mainly targeted at developers and early adopters who want to test the latest web technologies or see upcoming changes.
- Runs Independently: One advantage of Chrome Canary is that it can be installed alongside a stable version of Chrome, allowing users to use both simultaneously. This setup enables users to test new features while still having a reliable version of Chrome for their regular browsing.

### Chrome Beta

- More Stable than Canary: After features have been tested in Canary and deemed relatively stable, they move to the Chrome Beta channel.
- Updated Less Frequently: Typically, Chrome Beta is updated weekly, with major updates coming every six weeks or so.
- Broader Audience: While still primarily for developers and enthusiasts, Chrome Beta is aimed at a slightly broader audience. Users get a sneak peek of features that are likely to land in the stable version in the near future.
- Feedback Channel: Chrome Beta provides an opportunity for a wider set of users to provide feedback on upcoming features and changes, helping Google refine them before they reach the general public.

### Chrome Dev

Chrome also has a "Dev" channel, which sits between Canary and Beta in terms of stability. [Chrome Dev](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/) offers a more updated version of the browser compared to the Stable Channel but is generally more refined than the Canary and Beta channels. Each channel serves a purpose in the development and testing process of new features, bug fixes, and other changes.

- Middle Ground: The Dev Channel sits between the Canary and Beta channels in the development pipeline. It’s more stable than the Canary channel but is more experimental than the Beta channel.
- Update Frequency: While the Canary channel typically sees daily updates, and the Beta channel gets updated roughly every week, the Dev channel's update frequency is somewhere in between, often receiving updates multiple times a week.
- Target Audience: The Dev Channel is primarily aimed at developers and advanced users who want a relatively stable environment to test new features but are also willing to tolerate some bugs and instability. It's a bit of a compromise between the cutting-edge nature of Canary and the higher stability of Beta.
- Feedback and Testing: The Dev Channel is an essential part of Chrome’s development process. Feedback from users of this channel helps Google identify and fix issues before they reach the Beta or Stable channels.
- Runs Independently: Just like Canary, you can install the Dev version alongside your regular Chrome browser. This allows users to test the Dev version while still retaining a more stable version for daily browsing.

### Testing

Using this release channels, one can test our sites in environments that represent the state of the world once 3P cookies are phased out, and the new platform/chrome capabilities which can be used to replace 3P cookies are in place. To learn more about this, check the section on [Testing on Chrome Release Channels](/docs/3pc-readiness/chrome-release-channels).
